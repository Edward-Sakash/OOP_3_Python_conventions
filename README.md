# Python OOP Concepts - The Aquarium App

A friend of yours has created a little program in Python to try to simulate what is happening in an aquarium. Unfortunately, your friend did not pay much attention to naming conventions  while studying Python. So while the program is working, as it should, it is not following coming naming conventions and therefore it will be harder for other developers to work on in the future.

It is your task to modify the app.py file so that it follows common Python naming conventions.

When running **app.py**, the output should still look like this after your changes:

5 fish are swimming. Their eyes are blue and their skin is red.
There are 0 dead fish with them in the aquarium.
The fish have now been swimming 1 times.
2 fish have died.
3 fish are swimming. Their eyes are blue and their skin is red.
There are 2 dead fish with them in the aquarium.
The fish have now been swimming 2 times.
A fish has died.
2 fish are swimming. Their eyes are blue and their skin is red.
There are 3 dead fish with them in the aquarium.
The fish have now been swimming 3 times.
2 fish have died.
There are no alive fish left.
All fish are dead.
GAME OVER 

### Overview of app.py:

This file includes both the class _**aquarium_app**_ and at the bottom the main method that will run the example. You should not change the functionality of the class so the output should remain the same. You should modify the names of variables, methods, classes, etc. to match Python conventions.
